Short definitions for terms used across the wiki. For non-engineers in sales/SA roles.

## A

**Air-gap** — a network configuration where the host cannot reach the public internet (or even an internal network outside its security perimeter). Common in banks, government, defense, hospitals.

**API schema** — the shape of a request/response. jina-airgap exposes four simultaneously: OpenAI, Cohere, Google Gemini, Voyage AI. Each is a recognized industry contract, so customer apps usually work without code change.

## B

**Bundle** — the act of building a self-contained Docker image with weights, deps, and server code baked in. Also the resulting `.tar.gz`. Phase 1 of jina-airgap.

## C

**ColBERT** — a "late interaction" retrieval model. Instead of one vector per document, it produces many per-token vectors and scores at query time. Higher quality, more storage. jina-airgap supports `jina-colbert-v1-en` and `jina-colbert-v2`.

**CrossEncoder** — a model that takes a (query, document) pair and outputs a relevance score. The architecture pattern behind rerankers.

**CUDA** — NVIDIA's GPU programming platform. Required for GPU images. Driver version >=525 needed for our CUDA 12.1 images.

## D

**Deploy** — Phase 2. `docker load` + `docker run` on the offline machine. Takes seconds. No network needed.

**Docker** — the container runtime jina-airgap targets. Both bundle and deploy phases require Docker.

## E

**Embedding** — a fixed-size numerical vector that represents the meaning of a piece of text (or image, audio, video). Used for semantic search, clustering, classification.

**Elasticsearch inference service** — Elastic's plugin system for calling external models. jina-airgap registers as `service: openai` (embeddings) or `service: cohere` (rerank).

## F

**FastAPI** — the Python web framework powering the jina-airgap server. Gives you `/docs` Swagger UI for free.

## G

**GHCR** — GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`). Where prebuilt jina-airgap images live. Requires `docker login` with a GitHub PAT (`read:packages` scope).

## H

**HF Hub** — Hugging Face Model Hub. Where weights are downloaded from during Phase 1. Never called at runtime (`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` baked in).

## L

**L4** — NVIDIA's mid-range datacenter GPU (24 GB VRAM). The workhorse for jina-airgap deployments.

## M

**Matryoshka** — embeddings designed so any prefix is also a valid embedding. Pass `dimensions: 128` to a 1024-dim model to get a smaller vector with no quality cliff. Named after Russian nesting dolls.

**Multimodal** — handles multiple input types (text + image + audio + video). v5-omni, v4, clip-v2, vlm are multimodal. Other models are text-only.

## O

**Omni** — Jina's prefix for multimodal v5 models (`v5-omni-nano`, `v5-omni-small`). Accept any combination of text, image, audio, video.

**OpenAI-compatible** — accepts requests in OpenAI's `/v1/embeddings` shape. Drop-in for any client using `openai.OpenAI(base_url=...)`.

## P

**Phase 1 / Phase 2** — Phase 1 = bundle (requires network), Phase 2 = deploy (offline). The two-phase model is the whole product.

**Prebuilt** — a `.tar.gz` jina-airgap already published to GHCR. Saves you from building yourself. See the "Prebuilt" column in the README.

## R

**Reranker** — a model that takes a query + a list of candidate documents and returns relevance scores. Used after retrieval to improve top-K precision. jina-airgap supports `jina-reranker-v3` and earlier versions.

**Runtime** — `cpu` or `gpu`. Bundle once per runtime; deploy the appropriate one on the appropriate host.

## S

**SentenceTransformer** — the Python library used to load and run most embedding models. jina-airgap uses it internally.

## T

**Task** — embedding optimization hint. v5 supports `retrieval` (default), `text-matching`, `classification`, `clustering`. Pass via the `task` field. Different tasks produce different embeddings for the same input.

**`.tar.gz`** — the gzipped Docker image. Output of `docker save | gzip`. The unit of transport for an air-gapped bundle.

## V

**v5 / v4 / v3 / v2 / v1** — model generations. v5 (2026) is the latest with multimodal omni variants. v3 (2024) is widely deployed and stable. v2/v1 are Apache-2.0 licensed (free for commercial use).

**Voyage AI** — a vendor whose API jina-airgap is compatible with. Both `/v1/embeddings` (with `input_type` / `output_dimension`) and `/v1/multimodalembeddings` work.

**VLM** — Vision-Language Model. Like a chat LLM but accepts images. jina-airgap has `jina-vlm` (2.4B params).

**VRAM** — GPU memory. Each model has a recommended minimum; see [Model Catalog](Model-Catalog).
