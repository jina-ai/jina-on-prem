# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

An on-prem / air-gapped deployment toolkit for Jina AI models. It bundles embedding, reranker, reader, ColBERT, CLIP, and VLM models into self-contained Docker images that run fully offline. It is **not** a model-training or LLM-chat serving project — inference is embeddings + reranking, served via `sentence-transformers` / HuggingFace `transformers` on PyTorch (no vLLM, ONNX, or TensorRT).

## The two-phase mental model

Everything is organized around two phases, and confusing them causes most mistakes:

1. **Bundle (Phase 1, network-connected):** `jina-on-prem.py bundle` reads `models/catalog.json`, runs a two-stage `docker build` that downloads weights from HF Hub, patches model code for offline use, deletes the model repo's own `requirements.txt`, bakes in pinned deps, then `docker save | gzip` → `MODEL.tar.gz`.
2. **Deploy (Phase 2, offline):** `docker load < MODEL.tar.gz` then `docker run -p 8080:8080`. No repo, no Python, no network — just Docker. `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` + `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` are baked in so any code path that would hit the network fails instead of phoning home.

## Common commands

```bash
# Browse the model catalog
python jina-on-prem.py list [--type embedding|reranker|reader|colbert|vlm] [--modality text|multimodal|code] [-v] [--json]

# Bundle an image (Phase 1, needs network). Omit --cpu-only for the GPU variant.
python jina-on-prem.py bundle --model jina-embeddings-v5-text-nano --cpu-only --yes
python jina-on-prem.py bundle --model <id> --dry-run     # print the plan, build nothing

# Deploy a saved tarball (Phase 2, offline)
python jina-on-prem.py deploy --image MODEL.tar.gz --port 8080 [--gpu] [--detach]

# Serve directly without Docker (only if the model's deps are already installed locally)
python jina-on-prem.py serve --model jinaai/jina-embeddings-v5-text-nano --port 8080
python jina-on-prem.py serve --local-path /data/models/jina-v5-nano

# Mint an offline license key (see Licensing below)
python jina-on-prem.py keygen --sub acme-corp --days 90 [--model <id>] [--secret <s>] [--json]
```

The CLI (`jina-on-prem.py`) is intentionally **stdlib-only, zero third-party imports** — it must run on a bare builder machine before any deps are installed. Do not add imports of `torch`, `requests`, etc. to it. Model deps live inside the Docker image only. `bundle`/`deploy`/`serve`/`keygen` also have hidden single-word aliases.

## Tests

```bash
# License gate — pure unit tests, no server/Docker/network
python tests/test_license.py

# App import + default-task logic — imports server/app.py (pulls torch/transformers), no weights
python tests/test_default_task.py

# End-to-end API tests against a LIVE server (start a container first)
TEST_URL=http://localhost:8080 python tests/test_e2e.py

# Smoke-test a freshly built image (starts container, waits on /health, hits /v1/embeddings or /v1/rerank)
bash test_airgap.sh jina/jina-embeddings-v5-text-nano:cpu
```

There is no pytest harness or single-test selector — tests are plain scripts with a `check(name, cond)` helper that print PASS/FAIL and exit non-zero on failure. Run a whole file; to run one case, edit the file.

## Architecture and where things live

- **`models/catalog.json`** is the single source of truth: 28 models, each with `hf_repo`, `type`, `deps` (exact pinned versions), `vram_gb`, `matryoshka_dims`, `tasks`, `prebuilt`, etc. Bundle behavior is data-driven from here.
- **`docker/Dockerfile.cpu`** (`python:3.11-slim`) and **`docker/Dockerfile.gpu`** (`pytorch/pytorch` + CUDA, FP16) are both two-stage: stage 1 downloads+patches weights, stage 2 installs pinned deps and copies weights in. GPU image optionally compiles `flash-attn`.
- **`docker/download_model.py`** runs in build stage 1: downloads weights, applies offline-compatibility patches to model code (e.g. `custom_st.py`, `modeling_jina_embeddings_v5.py`), and **deletes every `requirements.txt` in the HF cache** so the model can't auto-upgrade `transformers` at runtime.
- **`server/app.py`** is one FastAPI server speaking **four schemas simultaneously** on `:8080`: OpenAI/Voyage (`/v1/embeddings`), Cohere (`/v1/embed`), Google Gemini (`:embedContent` / `:batchEmbedContents`), plus `/v1/rerank`, `/v1/multimodalembeddings`, and `/v1/chat/completions` (VLM/reader only). Only a schema-specific response shaper is protocol-aware; the underlying `model.encode()` call is shared. `_resolve_task()` maps API-level task names (e.g. Cohere `search_query`) to the model generation's own task names (v5/v4/v3 differ).
- **`server/license.py`** is the license gate (see below), wired in as a FastAPI middleware in `app.py`.
- **`scripts/`**: `bootstrap-gcp.sh` (provision a GCP builder), `pull-prebuilt.sh` (pull a GHCR image and tar.gz it for transport), `gen_catalog_md.py` (regenerate the Model Catalog wiki page from `catalog.json`), `sync-wiki.sh` (push `docs/` to the GitHub wiki).
- **`docs/`** mirrors the GitHub wiki and is edited via PRs, then synced. `docs/Architecture.md` and `docs/Licensing.md` are the deepest references.

## Non-obvious rules (from hard-won debugging — see CONTRIBUTING.md)

- **Never loosen the `transformers`/`sentence-transformers` pins in `catalog.json`.** They are exact for a reason (e.g. v5-text needs `Qwen3Config` from 4.51; v5-omni needs `Qwen3VLVisionConfig` from 4.57). HF model repos request `transformers>=5.x`, which breaks these models — that's why their `requirements.txt` is deleted at build time.
- **Rerankers load as `CrossEncoder`, not `SentenceTransformer`,** and Qwen3-based rerankers need `pad_token = eos_token` set after load or batch inference crashes. Test rerankers on `/v1/rerank`, not `/v1/embeddings`.
- **Do not test air-gap with `--network=none`** — it kills the host↔container network too. The real guarantee is the offline env vars + baked weights; test with normal `-p 8080:8080`.
- `app.py` monkey-patches `transformers.dynamic_module_utils.resolve_trust_remote_code` to always return `True`, using `*args, **kwargs` because the signature changed between transformers 4.51 and 5.x. Preserve that shape.
- **GHCR packages default to private** even from a public repo, and there is no API to flip them — it's a manual per-package web-UI step (`scripts/check-prebuilt-visibility.sh` audits state). Dockerfiles carry `LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source=...` so images link back to the repo.
- The `:gpu-opt` throughput images and their dynamic-batcher env vars (`JINA_BATCH_TOKENS`, `JINA_MERGE_TASK`, `JINA_LEAN`, `JINA_COMPILE`, …) are documented in the README, but that batcher serving stack is **not** in this tree — `server/app.py` is the single-request server. Don't assume those env vars exist in this code.

## Runtime env vars the server reads

`JINA_MODEL_ID` (which model is loaded), `JINA_DTYPE` / `JINA_CPU_AUTOCAST` (precision), `JINA_OFFLINE` / `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` / `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` / `HF_HOME` (offline enforcement + cache), and the license vars below.

## Licensing (license gate)

`server/license.py` + the middleware in `app.py` implement an **offline, HMAC-signed, expiring entitlement signal — not DRM.** The signing secret ships in the image on purpose (防君子不防小人); a technical user can trivially mint or bypass a key. Key design invariant: **a paying, deployed customer must never be blocked.**

- Modes via `JINA_LICENSE_MODE`: **`warn`** (default, fail-open — always serves, only logs + reports in `/health`; ship sold customers here), **`enforce`** (returns 403 on missing/expired/invalid past grace — trials/POCs only), **`off`** (no checks). `JINA_LICENSE_GRACE_DAYS` (default 14) keeps an expired key working in enforce mode. Legacy `JINA_LICENSE_ENFORCE=0/1` still maps to off/enforce.
- Key format: `JINA-<base64url(payload)>.<base64url(hmac_sha256)>`; payload is `{sub, iat, exp, model, v}`. `decide()` is the single authority on whether to serve and is wrapped to fail open on any unexpected error. `/health`, `/`, `/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`, `/favicon.ico` are always open; only inference POSTs are ever gated.

## Conventions

- Commit message prefixes in use: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `build:`, `experiment:`.
- Markdown in `docs/` mirrors the wiki — keep API examples to one curl per schema, no verbose request/response schemas (see CONTRIBUTING.md "README maintenance").
- When adding a model: add it to `catalog.json` with pinned `deps`, then regenerate the catalog wiki page via `scripts/gen_catalog_md.py`.
